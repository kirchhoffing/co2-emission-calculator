# OVERVIEW: Internal Guide for AI Coding Assistants

Purpose of this file:
This file is not intended for humans or end users. It is meant to guide AI assistants and copilot tools working on this project â€” to prevent duplication, understand the current structure, and maintain consistency across the codebase.

------------------------------

PROJECT SUMMARY

- Project name: CO2 Emission Calculator
- Goal: A full-stack TypeScript web app that allows businesses to calculate and report CO2 emissions (Scope 1, 2, partial 3)
- Stack: 100% TypeScript (frontend, backend, database, testing, CI)
- Status: Project is in progress; base setup is complete

------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AI ASSISTANTS

* Use only TypeScript. Do not generate Python, Java, etc.
* The frontend uses Next.js App Router. It is already initialized.
* Do not create folders like "src", "api", or "shared"
* Use tRPC for API communication. No REST or GraphQL.
* Use Kysely for database access. Do not use Prisma.
* Use Drizzle Kit for migrations.
* Shared logic like CO2 calculation must go under "packages/core"
* Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Do not use styled-components or CSS modules.
* Use GitHub Actions for CI. Do not introduce new CI tools.
* Do not add or duplicate anything that already exists.

------------------------------

PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE

- apps/web : Next.js frontend
- packages/core : Shared CO2 calculation logic
- packages/ui : Optional shared UI components
- db : Drizzle schema and migration files
- scripts : Helper scripts (like emission factor importer)
- tests : Vitest and Playwright test files

All code must stay within these folders. Do not add new folder trees.

------------------------------

MODULE STATUS (AS OF NOW)

* CO2 calculation logic: In progress (use packages/core)
* CSV import (energy, fuel): Not implemented (planned under scripts)
* PDF report generation: Not implemented (should use react-pdf)
* JSON export for XBRL: Not implemented
* Emission factor importer: Implemented or planned already
* Auth: Not implemented (use Auth.js only)
* Charting: Partially implemented (use TanStack Charts only)
* Email sending (PDF reports): Not implemented (will use Resend)

------------------------------

APPROVED TOOLS AND LIBRARIES

* Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Router, TanStack Form, TanStack Charts
* Backend: tRPC, Zod, node-cron
* Auth: Auth.js
* Database: PostgreSQL, Kysely, Drizzle Kit
* File upload: UploadThing or React Dropzone
* Testing: Vitest, Playwright
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Prettier, ESLint, Husky
* Email: Resend
* Env Management: Doppler

Do not install or use any libraries outside this list unless explicitly allowed.

------------------------------

PRIVACY AND COMPLIANCE

* All input data (energy, fuel) is sensitive
* GDPR compliance is required
* All changes must be audit-logged with timestamp and user ID
* Users must be able to delete and export their data
* AES-256 encryption should be used at rest

------------------------------

DO NOT DO THIS

* Do not use Prisma
* Do not use styled-components or CSS Modules
* Do not use non-TypeScript languages
* Do not create extra folder structures
* Do not create duplicate versions of existing logic

------------------------------

CONTINUE WORK LIKE THIS

* Reuse logic inside packages/core
* Add scripts to the scripts folder only
* Use Vitest and Playwright in tests folder
* Follow existing file layout strictly
* Use strict TypeScript typing
* Follow formatting and linting rules already defined

------------------------------

PAGE STRUCTURE AND UI/UX ARCHITECTURE

MAIN APPLICATION ROUTES:
* Public: /, /auth/*, /privacy, /terms
* Dashboard: /dashboard (main overview)
* Calculator: /calculator, /calculator/scope-1, /calculator/scope-2, /calculator/scope-3
* Data Management: /import, /import/energy, /import/fuel
* Reporting: /reports, /reports/[reportId], /analytics
* User: /profile, /privacy-center, /help
* Admin: /admin, /admin/audit-log, /admin/users, /admin/emission-factors

REUSABLE UI COMPONENTS (packages/ui):
* Form: EmissionInput, FuelTypeSelector, DateRangePicker, UnitConverter, FormWizard
* Display: EmissionCard, DataTable, ChartContainer, AuditLogEntry, ReportPreview
* Layout: DashboardLayout, PublicLayout, AdminLayout, Modal, Sidebar, Header
* Utility: LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary, ConfirmDialog, Tooltip, LanguageToggle

FORM VALIDATION STRATEGY:
* TanStack Form + Zod schemas for all user inputs
* Real-time validation with accessibility support
* Progressive error disclosure
* Auto-save for long calculation forms
* Multi-step wizard validation

DATA ARCHITECTURE:
* Emissions data by scope (1, 2, partial 3)
* Calculation history with full audit trail
* Report templates and generated outputs
* User/company management with GDPR compliance
* Emission factors database with regular updates

MOBILE & ACCESSIBILITY:
* Mobile-first responsive design
* WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
* Touch-friendly interfaces (44px minimum)
* Keyboard navigation support
* Screen reader optimization
* High contrast mode support

GDPR COMPLIANCE FEATURES:
* Privacy center with data export/deletion
* Audit logging for all data changes
* Consent management system
* Data anonymization capabilities
* Regular compliance reporting

This file must be kept up to date as the project grows.
AI assistants must use this as the single source of truth.
